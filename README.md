# Music Player

Music Player inspired by Spotifys player and playlist, showcasing some of my own instrumental production that I have made.
This project uses Next.js, Spring Boot (which can be found [here](https://github.com/ofemiashiru/MusicStreamerBE)) and S3 on AWS to store the audio and image files.

Still in progress:

## Iteration #1

- Added navbar that collapses when screen is smaller, accompanied by a burger menu.
- Repositioned playlist so that it appears when the album art in the bottom left is clicked.
- Restyled the player colours and icons.
